                <p> Jamilur Reza Choudhury (born 15 November 1943) is a Bangladeshi civil engineer, professor, researcher, and education advocate. He is a former Adviser (Minister) to Caretaker Government of Bangladesh (April?June 1996). He is the vice chancellor of University of Asia Pacific. He is also the president of Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Committee from 2003. He was awarded Ekushey Padak by the Government of Bangladesh in the category of science and technology in 2017. He was inducted as a National Professor by the Government of Bangladesh in 2018.</p> <br/>

                                Choudhury was born in Sylhet (during British colonial rule) on 15 November 1943. His father, Abid Reza Choudhury (1905?1991), was a renowned civil engineer who had migrated to Dhaka in 1952 (after the Partition of India) from Rangauty, a rural area of Hailakandi (Assam, India). Abid was the first Muslim to graduate from Bengal Engineering and Science University, in 1929. His mother, Hayatun Nessa Choudhury (n√©e Laskor) (1922?2010) was a homemaker, from the Nitainagar area of Hailakandi. Jamilur is the middle child of five siblings.</p> <br/>

                                Choudhury began school in 1950 (age 6) at the Mymensingh Zilla School. After his family moved to Dhaka from Mymensingh in 1952, he transferred to Nawabpur Government High School, and transferred once more to a private Catholic school, St Gregory's High School, in 1953. Jamilur attended Dhaka College from 1957?1959 and earned his Bachelor of Science Degree (Civil Engineering) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 1963. Upon graduation from BUET (First Class First with Honours), he became a lecturer in the Civil Engineering Department that same year. He earned a Masters of Science in Engineering Degree (advanced structural engineering) in 1965 and a Ph.D. in structural engineering in 1968, both at University of Southampton.

Choudhury was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering (Honoris Causa) by Manchester University on 20 October 2010 ? the first person of Bangladeshi origin to receive this honor from a British University.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3 font-weight-bold">Biography:</h5> <p> Immediately after publication of results of BSC Engineering, he joined as a faculty of the former East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology (EPUET) pending formal appointment (perhaps due to marginalization of Bengalis by the Pakis)[citation needed]. In November 1963, he formally joined as a lecturer in the Department of Civil Engineering & began his long teaching career. In September 1964 he was awarded a scholarship by Burmashell to pursue MS in structural engineering. His thesis was on "Cracks in Concrete Beam using Computer Aided Design". In 1968, he was conferred a Ph.D. degree on the topic of "Shear Wall & Structural Analysis of High rise Building". After completing Ph.D. he returned to former East Pakistan in 1968 & joined the former East Pakistan University of Engineering & Technology as an assistant professor until the demise of E. Pakistan and the birth of a new nation, Bangladesh. In 1973 he was promoted to associate professor of Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)and in 1976 a full professor. In 1975, he was offered Nuffield scholarship to pursue post-doctoral Fellowship at Surrey University in the UK. Until 2001 he was working as a Professor at BUET. He was also entrusted with developing a "Computer Center" at BUET and was appointed the director for about 10 years. He served as vice-chancellor of BRAC University between 2001 and 2010. Choudhury was appointed the chairman of the task force for developing Software Export & IT Infrastructure in Bangladesh from 1997 to 2000 under Ministry of Commerce. He was a ranking member of the Prime Minister's Task Force on developing Digital Bangladesh. Besides he is involved with several local and international organizations. Currently, he is working as vice-chancellor of the University of Asia Pacific (UAP) . Under his intellectual leadership, University of Asia Pacific is now regarded as one of the most respected universities in Bangladesh. He was the Technical Adviser of Padma bridge. He is the president of Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Committee.</p> </br>

                        <h5 class="mt-3 font-weight-bold"> Career:</h5> <p>Khan's central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the idea of the "tube" structural system for tall buildings, including the framed tube, trussed tube, and bundled tube variants. His "tube concept", using all the exterior wall perimeter structure of a building to simulate a thin-walled tube, revolutionized tall building design.[21] Most buildings over 40 stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan's structural engineering principles.[22][23]

                            Lateral loads (horizontal forces) such as wind forces, seismic forces, etc., begin to dominate the structural system and take on increasing importance in the overall building system as the building height increases. Wind forces become very substantial, and forces caused by earthquakes, etc. are important as well. The tubular designs resist such forces for tall buildings. Tube structures are stiff and have significant advantages over other framing systems.[24] They not only make the buildings structurally stronger and more efficient, but also significantly reduce the structural material requirements. The reduction of material makes the buildings economically more efficient and reduces environmental impact. The tubular designs enable buildings to reach even greater heights. Tubular systems allow greater interior space and further enable buildings to take on various shapes, offering added freedom to architects.[25][26] These new designs opened an economic door for contractors, engineers, architects, and investors, providing vast amounts of real estate space on minimal plots of land. Khan was among a group of engineers who encouraged a rebirth in skyscraper construction after a hiatus of over thirty years.[27][8]

                        <h5 class="mt-3 font-weight-bold">Personal life:</h4>   <p>Since 1963, the new structural system of framed tubes became highly influential in skyscraper design and construction. Khan defined the framed tube structure as "a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube-like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation." Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads, for example from wind and earthquakes, are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space. The bundled tube structure is more efficient for tall buildings, lessening the penalty for height. The structural system also allows the interior columns to be smaller and the core of the building to be free of braced frames or shear walls that use valuable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity.
